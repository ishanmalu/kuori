/// Replaces the running app with a newly downloaded one, then relaunches.
///
/// Replacing your own bundle from the network is a capability worth being
/// careful with, so the check that matters is not the checksum — that comes
/// from the same release over the same connection, and proves only that the
/// download arrived intact. The real control is the code signature: the new
/// bundle must satisfy the *running* app's own designated requirement, which
/// pins the signing certificate. Whoever swapped the download cannot produce a
/// bundle signed with that key, so a substituted app fails before anything is
/// moved.
///
/// Everything is staged first and the old bundle is kept until the new one is
/// in place, so a failure at any step leaves the working app where it was.
///
/// Note that an ad-hoc signed build can never satisfy this: its designated
/// requirement pins the code hash of that exact build, so every new version
/// fails the check by construction. That is the correct answer rather than a
/// limitation to work around — without a stable signing identity there is no
/// way to tell a genuine update from a substituted one — so those builds fall
/// back to downloading and revealing the image for the user to install.
